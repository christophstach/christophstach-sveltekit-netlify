	<h2>Hi there!</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Christoph Stach. I am a proffessional software engineer. I started coding in the age
		of 12 and helped developing the schools website. From there on my programming journey started. I
		gained multiple years of work experience as a full stack engineer. Back in the days PHP was the
		tool of choice. Over the years I shifted more to frontend development. Wich is my main focus
		now. Anyway I am in general really interested serval kinds of programming and new technologies.
		I have als worked on more scientific projects like deep learning. Also for a while i worked on a
		pipeline to analize DNA sequences, a topic wich is more under the hood of bio informatics.
